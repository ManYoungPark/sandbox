--excerpt
--Methods:
-- The IDR assessment methodology consists of computing a set of quantitative measures referred to as IDR Snapshot. Our pilot study included a set of 8 measures that were specifically designed to be intuitive to interpret and would facilitate continuous monitoring. For example, the measure D3 assessed the total number of patients with at least one diagnosis, one laboratory result and one prescription. The IDR Snapshot also includes very basic measures, such as the total number of events (G1) and the total number of patients (G2) within the repository. We used the database of the Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS)[2] as the key data source  evaluated in this study. It integrates data from the NIH Clinical Center EHR system (Allscripts Sunrise Clinical Manager) and numerous other systems across several NIH institutes (e.g., National Cancer Instituteâ€™s C3D clinical trials data management system). The IDR Snapshot is an open source project (available at http://code.google.com/p/idrsnapshot) that uses Structured Query Language (ANSI SQL:2008) and can be executed on all major database platforms.
